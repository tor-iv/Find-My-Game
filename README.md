## Overview
The objective of this project is to build an easy to use, accessible, and useful website for people to find online games to play with their friends remotely. Especially due to the spike in Google Meets and Zoom usage, this website could find widespread success with people who canâ€™t interact in person with one another. The user has the ability to customize fields like number of players, time available and age rating to filter through the games. 

This website will search through a database of games to filter out the ones which meet the needs outlined by the user. Once the user puts in the required attributes, the Python script will sort and search through the database in order to showcase a list of games on screen. The resulting list of games will have short descriptions about the games and direct links to the sites where the user can play the games. On the coding side, the JSON file used contains the database of the games to select from with each having their own attributes. The website is itself built with a back-end Python program and the user interface built with HTML/CSS.
